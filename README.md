Bar-Fight-1863
==============

A Historical Fighting Game for iOS

This is a little project game I am currently working on so feel free to suggest edits as I am not contributing regularly. I hope to release Bar Fights 1863 on the App Store when this game is completed. This game uses Sprite Kit in combination with Game Center and is written in Swift with a little bit of Objective-C on the side. :)
